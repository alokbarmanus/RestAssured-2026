serialization is a conversion of the state of a Java object to a byte stream and
Deserialization is the reverse of it, i.e. conversion od a byte stream to corresponding Java object.
A serialize object can be stored files, external resources, database etc and can also be transferred over network.

To make a Java object serializable, either its class or any of its supre classes implements either the Serializable interface or its subinterface externalizable.
A class the implements Serializable or externalizable are actually Java Beans.

A Plain Old Java Object i.e. POJO has no such restriction.
We generally use POJO class to create JSON payload and convert JSON response payload to Java objects.
Converting a POJO object to a JSON object is Serialization and
Converting a JSON object to a POJO object is called deserialization.
These conversions can be done with help of Java libraries like Jacson, Gson etc.
We do not need to implement the required interfaces for POJO classes.
